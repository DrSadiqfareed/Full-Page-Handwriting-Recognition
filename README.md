# Vision Transformer for Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

This project implements an OCR model based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. It aims to recognize and extract text from images using the power of Transformers, which are particularly effective for sequence-to-sequence tasks like OCR. The model reads input images, processes them through a Vision Transformer, and outputs the recognized text sequences.

## Project Overview

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is crucial for applications such as document scanning, license plate recognition, and real-time text extraction. This project leverages the Vision Transformer (ViT) for end-to-end OCR tasks, effectively capturing both spatial and sequential relationships in text images. By encoding image patches, the Vision Transformer can learn dependencies and patterns in text data without requiring recurrent layers.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset should include images and their corresponding labels (text files). Ensure that each image file has a text file containing the label with the same filename but a `.txt` extension.

Example structure:
dataset/ ├── image1.png ├── image1.txt ├── image2.png ├── image2.txt └── ...

Each image file should contain text (e.g., license plates, document text, etc.), and the text file contains the ground truth label.

## Model Architecture

The model utilizes a **Vision Transformer (ViT)**, which divides each image into patches and applies a transformer to capture dependencies across patches. The main components include:
- **Patch Embedding Layer**: Converts images into patches and then into sequences of embedded vectors.
- **Transformer Encoder Layers**: Captures long-range dependencies between patches.
- **Output Dense Layers**: Decodes the patch embeddings into character sequences for OCR tasks.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the implementation)
- OpenCV
- NumPy

### Installation
To install the necessary packages, run:
```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python-headless numpy
Replace tensorflow with torch if using PyTorch.

Training the Model
Prepare your dataset in the specified format.
Set the dataset_folder variable in the notebook to the path where the dataset is located.
Run the training cells in the notebook.
Training Parameters
Batch Size: Default is 32, but may be adjusted based on available memory.
Image Size: Configured for Vision Transformer input (typically 224x224 or 256x256 pixels).
Epochs: The model generally requires multiple epochs to achieve optimal performance.
Usage
To use the trained model:

Load the model using the saved model file (.h5 for TensorFlow, .pth for PyTorch).
Preprocess your input images as required by the Vision Transformer architecture (resizing, normalization).
Run inference on new images to obtain OCR results.
Example usage in code:
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

# Load the trained model
model = load_model('/path/to/saved_model.h5')

# Process and predict
predictions = model.predict(preprocessed_image)
Evaluation and Results
The model can be evaluated using:

Character Accuracy: Percentage of correctly recognized characters in the test set.
Word Accuracy: Percentage of completely correct words or phrases.
During training, validation accuracy is calculated to monitor performance, and test accuracy is evaluated post-training.

Future Work
The Vision Transformer OCR model can be improved and extended in the following ways:

Fine-tuning Transformer Parameters: Experiment with the number of layers, heads, and embedding dimensions.
Data Augmentation: Apply augmentations like rotation, blurring, and brightness changes to improve generalization.
Attention Visualization: Implement attention maps to visualize which parts of the image the model focuses on.
Domain-Specific OCR: Tailor the model for specific OCR tasks (e.g., license plates, handwritten documents).

### Tips:
- **Link to Resources**: Add links to relevant papers (e.g., ViT papers) or blog posts to help users understand the architecture.
- **Add Screenshots or Results**: If possible, include sample images of OCR outputs in the README.
- **Customize for Framework**: Tailor commands and instructions based on whether TensorFlow or PyTorch is used.

Let me know if there are any specific details from the notebook you'd like incorporated in the README!
